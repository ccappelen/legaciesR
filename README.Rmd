# legaciesr

<!-- badges: start -->

The `legaciesr` package provides a set of functions used to aggregate and summarize the mapping data collected in the [LEGACIES](https://www.legacies-project.com) project. It allows users to, i.a., (1) create contour polygons capturing the territorial extent of historical states at different probability thresholds, (2) create a grid with various summary measures of historical state presence, and (3) add a range of commonly used covariates to the polygon and grid data.  

NB: The package is still experimental and no functions should be considered stable. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of legaciesr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ccappelen/legaciesR")
```

## Handling of invalid geometries

The functions in `legaciesr` will (by default) attempt to fix invalid geometries which would otherwise return an error. The fixes rely on `legaciesr::fix_invalid()` which is a wrapper around the `sf::st_make_valid()` function that attempts to reiteratively lower the allowed precision to rebuild valid geometries. However, because invalid geometries can happen for many reasons that may point to other data errors as well, it is recommended to check for valid geometries and run the `legaciesr::fix_invalid()` to identify potential issues. See package documentation for further information on the use of this function. 

```{r fix invalid geometries, eval = FALSE}
library(legaciesr)

sf::st_is_valid(df)

df_fixed <- fix_invalid(df)

```

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN. -->
