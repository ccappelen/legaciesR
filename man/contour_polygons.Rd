\usage{
contour_polygons(
  shp,
  cuts = 4,
  id_vars,
  smooth_method = c("ksmooth", "chaikin", "spline"),

}
\arguments{
\item{shp}{The SF PolygonsDataFrame to be aggregated. Must consist of more than one feature.}

\item{cuts}{An integer of length 1 specifying the number of (equally spaced) contour polygons to be returned.
For example, if \code{cuts = 10} the function will return 10 polygons representing the 10 deciles (0-0.1,0.1-0.2,...).}

\item{id_vars}{Group identifiers}

\item{smooth_method}{Character scalar specifying the smoothing method used to convert raster to polygon.
The options are \code{"ksmooth"} (default), \code{"chaikin"}, and \code{"spline"}.}

\item{smoothness_factor}{Numerical scalar indicating the amount of smoothing the \code{\link[smoothr]{smooth}} function should do.
Default is 2.}

\item{res}{Resolution of the raster used to calculate polygon density. Higher resolution (i.e., lower numbers)
creates smoother borders but also increases processing time. Default is 1/30 degrees.}

\item{invalid_geom}{One of "none" (default), "exclude", "fix_exclude", or "fix_all". The function attempts to rebuild invalid geometries
using sf::st_make_valid(shp). However, some geometries may be invalid even after attempting to rebuild. If "none" the function will
return an error in case of invalid geometries (after attempting to rebuild). If "exclude", any invalid geometries will be removed.
If "fix_exclude", invalid geometries will be rebuilt using default arguments and any remaining invalid
geometries will be removed. If "fix_all", the function will attempt to rebuild invalid geometries by
iteratively lowering the snappingnprecision (in \code{s2::s2_snap_precision()}). It will return an error
if it fails to rebuild valid geometries. The use of "fix_all" is experimental and the result should be
inspected manually.
@param include_higher logical, whether the contour polygons should include percentiles above current interval.
If TRUE (default), the 50 % polygon will include all areas covered by at least 50 % of the shapes
(and not just within the specified interval, e.g., 0.75-1, 0.50-1, 0.25-1...). If FALSE, the polygon will include only areas
within the specified interval (e.g., 0.75-1, 0.50-0.75, 0.25-0.50...).}
}
\value{
Returns an SF PolygonsDataFrame with the same number of features as specified in *cuts*. The density,
 or percentile, is stored in the attributes \code{"prob"} and \code{"label"}.
}
\description{
This function creates contour polygons from multiple overlapping polygons.
